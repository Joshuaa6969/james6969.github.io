photography is what gets you through the dark months<br>

For me, photography is a way to see the world in a different way. <br>It's a way to capture moments and memories that would otherwise <br> be lost. It's a way to connect with people and places. <br>It's a way to tell stories. And it's a way to make the world a little bit brighter.</h2>
