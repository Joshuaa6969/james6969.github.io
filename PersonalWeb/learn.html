    <h1>Things I want to learn more</h1>
   <p>When somene wants to learn
about new things,<br> they have to be open minded. Instead of doing<br> the same things every single day, <br>it is beneficial to try new things. 
<br><br><br>
As of now, I want to try singing and acting.<br> On how singers and actors deal with<br> their passion and talents in ths world. On how <br> some people take it and see it as<br> if it is their life. 
<br><br><br>
I believe that learning is <br>a relatively permanent change in behavior <br> or knowledge that results from experience.
